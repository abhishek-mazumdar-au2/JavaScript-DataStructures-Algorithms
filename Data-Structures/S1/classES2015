what is a class??

-- A blueprint or a patter for creating objects (or, data-structures) with pre-defined properties and methods.
-- JavaScript doesn't really have classes, the one invented in 2015 is basically syntacting sugar. 
-- It takes help of prototypal-based-inheritence.
-- technically it is not true object-oriented-programming.
-- Array is technically not a class.
