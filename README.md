  ## Big O Notation
  ### It allows us to talk or to express how exactly the runtime of an algorithm grows as th input grows. we need not care a lot about the details, as this is only a basic nderstanding course. 

  ### We say that an algorith of O(f(n)) if the number of simple operations the computer has to do is eventually less than a constant times f(n), as n increases.
